\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/A1-4.pdf}
According to Figure@ref(fig:A1), developed countries such as United
States and France both have the lowest inflation rate in 2015. This is
because in 2015, the crude oil price collapsed.
(\url{https://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/what-triggered-oil-price-plunge-2014-2016-and-why-it-failed-deliver-economic-impetus-eight-charts}),
and the global economy has not recovered from the GFC yet.
((\url{https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-inflation-idUSKCN0UY1LH})).

Moreover, low inflation rate does not mean the currency is more
valuable. On the contrary, it signals demand for goods and services is
lower than expected and will then result in recession and the an
increase in unemployment.
(\url{https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/06/inflation-is-healthy-for-the-economy-but-too-much-can-trigger-a-recession-7d37501704})

Additionally, developed countries usually have more stable inflation
rate than developing countries. This is to keep the economy and the
currency stable.

\hypertarget{gender-distribution-for-labour-force}{%
\subsection{Gender distribution for labour
force}\label{gender-distribution-for-labour-force}}

Moreover, the labour force in each country is increasing but decreasing
in France. We will take a deeper look in the employment and unemployment
in the following sections and try to conclude why the labour force for
France is decreasing.

Let's also look at the gender distribution in the labour force.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/A3-1.pdf}

Figure@ref(fig:A3) shows the lines for female labour force and the male
labour force are almost overlapped with each other, meaning the gender
distribution for labour force is fairly equal in these countries.

Figure@ref(fig:A4) shows the life expectancy for female is obviously
higher than male. More interestingly, US and France are having a stable
life expectancy from 2011 til 2019, while in Egypt and Colombia, the
life expectancy for both genders is increasing.

\hypertarget{employment-analysis-by-country}{%
\subsection{Employment Analysis by
Country}\label{employment-analysis-by-country}}

The core analysis of this report is to analyze the different workforce
distribution among high and low income countries and the gender
distribution inside them. High income countries such as United States
and France and low income such as Colombia and Egypt were taken into
account to evaluate the labor force condition and the general trends of
the citizens performing jobs in agriculture, industry and services jobs.

Having a closer look to the data, the distribution in the job market
according to the gender and country it is taking part in, tends to
variate according to the economy of each country. High income countries
such as United States or France manages a similar trend in every
industry according to the gender. But also, it can be seen that the
rates are different compared to the low income countries.

\hypertarget{high-income-countries-workforce}{%
\subsection{High Income Countries
Workforce}\label{high-income-countries-workforce}}

The higher income countries have, the higher participation in services
by males. On the other hand, there is lower concentration in the
participation of female in industries that are considered ``Masculine''
for the time being, agriculture and industry.

For high income countries the similarity in the allocation of workforce
among the studies industries is surprisingly similar. in the figure
@ref(fig:highinc) USA and France have an average of 67\% of male
workforce, also, have a similar percentage by 2019 in industry of 30\%
and in agriculture of 4\%.

Generally, females are on top of the chart with about 90\% working in
services, and with similar rates for agriculture and industry of 1\% and
9\% respectively.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/highinc-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{low-income-countries-workforce}{%
\subsection{Low Income Countries
Workforce}\label{low-income-countries-workforce}}

Males in the job market for low income countries keep similar trends for
the jobs in agriculture. In 2019, in Colombia and Egypt got in average
25\% of male participation. In industry, Colombia and Egypt have a
notorious difference of 25\% and 32\% respectively.

In the case of females, they keep an average from 10\% to 20\% in
``Masculine'' jobs, as per in services, they keep from 50\% to 80\%.
Egypt had a huge decline in the agricultural jobs for females from a
43\% to 21\%. It is remarkable this variation along the previous 9 years
as well as that the woman workforce seemed to move in the same rate to
the services industry as seen in the figure @ref(fig:lowinc) below.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/lowinc-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{gender-workforce-distribution-by-country}{%
\subsection{Gender Workforce Distribution by
Country}\label{gender-workforce-distribution-by-country}}

As seen in the current analysis the economical capacity of the countries
can infer in the workforce distribution. In a general view of the
selected samples, females have in all of them the highest rate of
employment in services as well as the lowest in agriculture, this does
not apply in Egypt but the current trend is showing that there is a
moving out of that industry.

Similarly, males have the highest level of employment in services, but
they keep leading the industry and agricultural workforce. It is
noticeable that if a country is wealthy, there is a higher level of
participation of females in service jobs compared to low income
countries. On the other hand, despite the income level of the country
males keep the same percentage among the countries. See figure
@ref(fig:allcountries).

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/allcountries-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{gender-workforce-comparison-by-industry.}{%
\subsection{Gender Workforce Comparison by
Industry.}\label{gender-workforce-comparison-by-industry.}}

From other point of view and analyzing the variables across all the
countries it can be seen that the genders maintain a similar level of
employment according to the selected industries.

\hypertarget{female-and-male-employment-in-agriculture.}{%
\subsection{Female and Male Employment in
Agriculture.}\label{female-and-male-employment-in-agriculture.}}

in the figure @ref(fig:agriculture) women keep the lowest participation
in agriculture and industry jobs in the selected countries except Egypt
which have had a decrease around of 50\% during the past 9 years,
keeping lowest rates compared to male results. The level of jobs have
been steady for males and females during the analyzed years.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/agriculture-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{female-and-male-employment-in-industry.}{%
\subsection{Female and Male Employment in
Industry.}\label{female-and-male-employment-in-industry.}}

In the case of industry jobs, male keep a highest rate compared to
female across the analyzed countries. In 2019 the number of female rose
by 5\% in Egypt, while in Colombia decreased by 2\% and in USA and
France maintained the same levels.

In the case of males, all the countries maintained about the same levels
since 2011 as seen in the figure @ref(fig:industry).

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/industry-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{female-and-male-employment-in-services.}{%
\subsection{Female and Male Employment in
Services.}\label{female-and-male-employment-in-services.}}

Female have a highest participation in the services sector compared to
males and across all the industries.

In general, all the countries kept the same average levels since 2011
and they are in a similar range despite the income level of the country.
But, Egypt has an interesting variation of the the jobs allocation. In
this case, females in services have rose over 30\% in the last years,
maintaining the leading over their male peers. In this Industry Egypt
has the lowest of people, but the trend keeps a future positive path as
well as France. See figure @ref(fig:services).

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/services-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{gender-workforce-by-industry}{%
\subsection{Gender Workforce by
Industry}\label{gender-workforce-by-industry}}

In summary, females across all countries have lower levels than male
occupations in agriculture and industry. On the other hand females have
the lead in the services job market, the most notorious case of growth
in this industry was Egypt that in 2019 the percentage of females in
this industry was 71\%.

From table @ref(tab:tabref) and table @ref(tab:tabref1) we can summarize
that clearly the percentage of female unemployment is way \emph{more in
developing countries} than that of the \emph{developed countries} like
US and France. For instance, in \textbf{2015} the reported percentage of
females unemployed in United States was just 5\% where as it was 24
percentage in developing countries like Egypt.

The gap in participation rates between men and women is narrowing in
developed countries but continues to widen in developing countries, as
we can observe that the percentage is almost equal for both males and
females in US and France where as in Columbia and Egypt,the employment
rate is more for men than women.\autocite{social}

Another interesting observation from table @ref(tab:tabref) and table
@ref(tab:tabref1) was seen that the overall unemployment tread in the
developing countries is more than that of developed countries. The basic
cause of this can be the deficiency of the availability of essential
consumer goods, often called wage goods \autocite{Education}.

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In regards of the employment in high and low income countries, it can be
seen that females are always leading the services sector and in the case
of males, industry and agriculture take the highest number of workers.
But overall, the highest income level, the lowest the amount of people
working in industries such as industry or agriculture.
