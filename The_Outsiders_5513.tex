\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The \href{https://data.worldbank.org/}{World Bank Data Group}
coordinates statistical and data work and maintains a number of macro,
financial and sector databases. The group is guided by professional
standards in the collection, compilation and dissemination of data to
ensure that all data users can have confidence in the quality and
integrity of the data produced.

Gender inequality remains a major barrier to human development. Girls
and women have made major strides since 1990, but they have not yet
gained gender equity. Women who want to work have a harder time finding
a job than men. This problem is particularly marked in developing
countries where unemployment rates for women is more than that of
developed countries.

Hence, the primary analysis of our report is to compare and contrast the
gender statistic in developed countries like \textbf{United States \&
France} and developing countries like \textbf{Colombia and Egypt} from
the years 2010 to 2019 on various factors like:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The section 1 of the report contains comparison of \textbf{inflation,
  gender distribution for labour force and life expectancy} in various
  countries.
\item
  The section 2 of the report contains gender work flow distribution and
  \textbf{gender work flow comparison in various sectors like
  agriculture, industry and service}
\item
  The section 3 of the report contains the analysis on the total
  unemployment difference between males and females and \textbf{analysis
  on the basis of qualifications in developed and developing countries.}

According to Figure@ref(fig:A1), developed countries such as United
States and France both have the lowest inflation rate in 2015. This is
because in 2015, the crude oil price collapsed. \autocite{stocker}, and
the global economy has not recovered from the GFC yet
\autocite{inflation1}.

Moreover, low inflation rate does not mean the currency is more
valuable. On the contrary, it signals demand for goods and services is
lower than expected and will then result in recession and the an
increase in unemployment \autocite{inflation2}.

Additionally, developed countries usually have more stable inflation
rate than developing countries. This is to keep the economy and the
currency stable.

\begin{table}

\hypertarget{gender-distribution-for-labour-force}{%
\subsection{Gender distribution for labour
force}\label{gender-distribution-for-labour-force}}

Moreover, the labour force in each country is increasing but decreasing
in France. We will take a deeper look in the employment and unemployment
in the following sections and try to conclude why the labour force for
France is decreasing.

Let's also look at the gender distribution in the labour force.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/A3-1.pdf}

Figure@ref(fig:A3) shows the lines for female labour force and the male
labour force are almost overlapped with each other, meaning the gender
distribution for labour force is fairly equal in these countries.

Figure@ref(fig:A4) shows the life expectancy for female is obviously
higher than male. More interestingly, US and France are having a stable
life expectancy from 2011 til 2019, while in Egypt and Colombia, the
life expectancy for both genders is increasing.

\hypertarget{employment-analysis-by-country}{%
\subsection{Employment Analysis by
Country}\label{employment-analysis-by-country}}

The core analysis of this report is to analyze the different workforce
distribution among high and low income countries and the gender
distribution inside them. High income countries such as United States
and France and low income such as Colombia and Egypt were taken into
account to evaluate the labor force condition and the general trends of
the citizens performing jobs in agriculture, industry and services jobs.

Having a closer look to the data, the distribution in the job market
according to the gender and country it is taking part in, tends to
variate according to the economy of each country. High income countries
such as United States or France manages a similar trend in every
industry according to the gender. But also, it can be seen that the
rates are different compared to the low income countries.
\autocite{femaleworkforce}

\hypertarget{high-income-countries-workforce}{%
\subsection{High Income Countries
Workforce}\label{high-income-countries-workforce}}

The higher income countries have, the higher participation in services
by males. On the other hand, there is lower concentration in the
participation of female in industries that are considered ``Masculine''
for the time being, agriculture and industry.

For high income countries the similarity in the allocation of workforce
among the studies industries is surprisingly similar. in the figure
@ref(fig:highinc) USA and France have an average of 67\% of male
workforce, also, have a similar percentage by 2019 in industry of 30\%
and in agriculture of 4\%.

Generally, females are on top of the chart with about 90\% working in
services, and with similar rates for agriculture and industry of 1\% and
9\% respectively.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/highinc-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{low-income-countries-workforce}{%
\subsection{Low Income Countries
Workforce}\label{low-income-countries-workforce}}

Males in the job market for low income countries keep similar trends for
the jobs in agriculture. In 2019, in Colombia and Egypt got in average
25\% of male participation. In industry, Colombia and Egypt have a
notorious difference of 25\% and 32\% respectively.

In the case of females, they keep an average from 10\% to 20\% in
``Masculine'' jobs, as per in services, they keep from 50\% to 80\%.
Egypt had a huge decline in the agricultural jobs for females from a
43\% to 21\%. It is remarkable this variation along the previous 9 years
as well as that the woman workforce seemed to move in the same rate to
the services industry as seen in the figure @ref(fig:lowinc) below.
\autocite{WDAgriculture}

\hypertarget{gender-workforce-distribution-by-country}{%
\subsection{Gender Workforce Distribution by
Country}\label{gender-workforce-distribution-by-country}}

As seen in the current analysis the economical capacity of the countries
can infer in the workforce distribution. In a general view of the
selected samples, females have in all of them the highest rate of
employment in services as well as the lowest in agriculture, this does
not apply in Egypt but the current trend is showing that there is a
moving out of that industry.

Similarly, males have the highest level of employment in services, but
they keep leading the industry and agricultural workforce. It is
noticeable that if a country is wealthy, there is a higher level of
participation of females in service jobs compared to low income
countries. On the other hand, despite the income level of the country
males keep the same percentage among the countries. See figure
@ref(fig:allcountries).

\hypertarget{gender-workforce-comparison-by-industry.}{%
\subsection{Gender Workforce Comparison by
Industry.}\label{gender-workforce-comparison-by-industry.}}

From other point of view and analyzing the variables across all the
countries it can be seen that the genders maintain a similar level of
employment according to the selected industries.

\hypertarget{female-and-male-employment-in-agriculture.}{%
\subsection{Female and Male Employment in
Agriculture.}\label{female-and-male-employment-in-agriculture.}}

in the figure @ref(fig:agriculture) women keep the lowest participation
in agriculture and industry jobs in the selected countries except Egypt
which have had a decrease around of 50\% during the past 9 years,
keeping lowest rates compared to male results. The level of jobs have
been steady for males and females during the analyzed years.

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/agriculture-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{female-and-male-employment-in-industry.}{%
\subsection{Female and Male Employment in
Industry.}\label{female-and-male-employment-in-industry.}}

In the case of industry jobs, male keep a highest rate compared to
female across the analyzed countries. In 2019 the number of female rose
by 5\% in Egypt, while in Colombia decreased by 2\% and in USA and
France maintained the same levels.

In the case of males, all the countries maintained about the same levels
since 2011 as seen in the figure @ref(fig:industry).

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/industry-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{female-and-male-employment-in-services.}{%
\subsection{Female and Male Employment in
Services.}\label{female-and-male-employment-in-services.}}

Female have a highest participation in the services sector compared to
males and across all the industries.

In general, all the countries kept the same average levels since 2011
and they are in a similar range despite the income level of the country.
But, Egypt has an interesting variation of the the jobs allocation. In
this case, females in services have rose over 30\% in the last years,
maintaining the leading over their male peers. In this Industry Egypt
has the lowest of people, but the trend keeps a future positive path as
well as France. See figure @ref(fig:services).

\includegraphics{The_Outsiders_5513_files/figure-latex/services-1.pdf}

\hypertarget{gender-workforce-by-industry}{%
\subsection{Gender Workforce by
Industry}\label{gender-workforce-by-industry}}

In summary, females across all countries have lower levels than male
occupations in agriculture and industry. On the other hand females have
the lead in the services job market, the most notorious case of growth
in this industry was Egypt that in 2019 the percentage of females in
this industry was 71\%.

From table @ref(tab:tabref) and table @ref(tab:tabref1) we can summarize
that clearly the percentage of female unemployment is way \emph{more in
developing countries} than that of the \emph{developed countries} like
US and France. For instance, in \textbf{2015} the reported percentage of
females unemployed in United States was just 5\% where as it was 24
percentage in developing countries like Egypt.

The gap in participation rates between men and women is narrowing in
developed countries but continues to widen in developing countries, as
we can observe that the percentage is almost equal for both males and
females in US and France where as in Columbia and Egypt,the employment
rate is more for men than women.\autocite{social}

Another interesting observation from table @ref(tab:tabref) and table
@ref(tab:tabref1) was seen that the overall unemployment tread in the
developing countries is more than that of developed countries. The basic
cause of this can be the deficiency of the availability of essential
consumer goods, often called wage goods \autocite{education}.

\end{figure}

Figure @ref(fig:Advancedeving) shows the unemployment percentage of
males and females with advanced education in developing countries like
Colombia and Egypt.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Unemployment rates fall with higher educational attainment. As shown
  in figures @ref(fig:Advancedeved) and @ref(fig:Advancedeving) we can
  see that the overall percentage of unemployment is between 2\% to 6\%
  in developed countries and close to 10\% in developing countries.
\item
  Moreover the difference between the ratio of males and females
  unemployed is also low with advanced education for all countries
  except Egypt, where the difference is close to 15\%. Possible reasons
  for that include the high cost of childcare, the expectation that
  women carry out the majority of household responsibilities, negative
  attitudes toward women in the workplace, lack of mobility, legal
  barriers, persistent wage gaps, sexual harassment in the workplace,
  and poor enforcement of anti-discrimination laws

Figure @ref(fig:Basicdeving) shows the unemployment percentage of males
and females with basic education in developing countries like Colombia
and Egypt.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is interesting to see that the percentage of unemployment of males
  is more than that of females for all the years in France
  @ref(fig:Basicdeved).
\item
  Figure @ref(fig:Basicdeving) Egypt shows that with just basic
  education the percentage of unemployment can decrease. The gap between
  males and females unemployment has gone down from 9\% to almost 3\%
  over the years.

Figure @ref(fig:Intermediatedeving) shows the unemployment percentage of
males and females with intermediate education in developing countries
like Colombia and Egypt.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Those with low educational attainment \textbf{intermediate education}
  are both less likely to be labor force participants and more likely to
  be unemployed. The greatest gender differences in unemployment rates
  are seen among adults with lower levels of education as shown in
  figure @ref(fig:Intermediatedeving). The percentage of female
  unemployment is close to 30\% in females whereas its 11\% for males
\item
  Whereas in developed countries even though the percentage of
  unemployment is high with intermediate education, its satisfying to
  see that it is almost equal for both males and females
  @ref(fig:Intermediatedeved). \autocite{education}
\end{itemize}

\clearpage

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

With the help of our analysis, we can conclude that even though the gap
between males and females is reducing in developed countries in terms of
employment, it is important that equal opportunities are given to the
female gender in the developing countries as well. As with this many
developing countries would also see their average annual GDP growth
increase.

In regards of the employment in high and low income countries, it can be
seen that females are always leading the services sector and in the case
of males, industry and agriculture take the highest number of workers.
But overall, the highest income level, the lowest the amount of people
working in industries such as industry or agriculture.
